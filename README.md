# Detection-of-Adversarial-Attacks-on-Machine-Learning-Based-Wireless-Communication-Systems
Repository of the code for my university research paper (attached in the repository).

Influenced and adversarial attacks produced by Meysam Sadeghi - https://github.com/meysamsadeghi/Security-and-Robustness-of-Deep-Learning-in-Wireless-Communication-Systems/tree/master/Adv_Attack_Modulation_Classification

Relies upon several files:
1) The 2016 synthetic radio signal dataset produced by DeepSig - https://www.deepsig.ai/datasets
2) The output of the model
